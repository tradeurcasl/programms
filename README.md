# programms

Here you can find some programms that I wrote just for fun & practice. Or maybe my portfolio.
Anyway here is the list of titles and little descriptions of them:

1) English_dict - includes 2 basic english dictionaries (data-json and mySQL version), where you should write word (for example, 'bird') and you'll get it's description. You can use it in your command line, but one day I'll create some GUI for it.
first_one.py - is a json-version
py_mysql.py - is a mysqlDB version
