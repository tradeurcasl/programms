# programms

Here you can find some programms that I wrote just for fun & practice. Or maybe my portfolio.
Anyway here is the list of titles and little descriptions of them:

1) English_dict - includes 2 basic english dictionaries (data-json and mySQL version), where you should write word (for example, 'bird') and you'll get it's description. You can use it in your command line, but one day I'll create some GUI for it.
    
    a. first_one.py - is a json-version
    
    b. py_mysql.py - is a mysqlDB version
    
2) Volacanomap - it is a map which includes map of West USA volcanoes and population density (unfortunatly, I have found only json for 2005, but if I found newer dataset, I'll change my programm). It also has controller to change modes (volcanoe only, population only, vol+pop)
